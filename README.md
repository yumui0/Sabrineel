# Sabrineel
Hi! I’m a high school student at Reaumur Laval, France, studying software engineering. I’m also a self-taught developer with a passion for CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. I love building cool things on the web and am always eager to learn more.

One phrase I live by: **“Do one thing that scares you every day.”**

Outside of coding, I enjoy gaming and connecting with people online. Feel free to connect with me on:

Let’s build, share, and have fun together!
